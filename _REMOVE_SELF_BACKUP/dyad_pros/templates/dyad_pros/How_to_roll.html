            How to roll the die
        </h3>

        <p>
            On your desk you have a cup and a six-sided die.
        </p>

        <p>
            To roll the die, pick up the cup, put the die in the cup, shake the cup a few times, and reverse it on your desk such that the bottom on the cup faces up.
            Then peek through the hole, to see the die roll outcome.
        </p>

        <p>
            Try this once or twice now â€“ roll the die and peek through the hole.
