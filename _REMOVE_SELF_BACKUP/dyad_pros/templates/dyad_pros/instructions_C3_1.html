    </h3>

    <p>
        The task has multiple rounds. Each round of the task goes as follows:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>You will see a number, between 1 and 6, appearing on the computer screen.
            The number that will appear on the screen is generated by another participant in the room who is engaging in a different task.
            This is <strong>not</strong> the person you are paired with.
            On a later page you will learn how this number is generated.</li>
        <li>After that, you will roll a die and will be asked to report the die roll outcome.</li>
        <li>At the end of each round, you will see the number that appeared on the screen, your own report, and the payoffs associated with that round.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        On the next page you will learn how the payoffs are determined.
