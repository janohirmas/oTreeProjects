        Numbers appearing on the screen (I)
    </h3>

     <p>
        The numbers that will appear on the screen are generated by two participants in the room who are paired together and engage in a different task than yours.
        One of the these two participants is the “first mover” and the other is the “second mover”.
    </p>

    <p>
        In each round of <strong>their</strong> task:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The first mover rolls a die and is asked to report the die roll outcome.</li>
        <li>After that, the second mover sees the number the first mover reported.</li>
        <li>Then, the second mover rolls a die and is asked to report the die roll outcome.</li>
        <li>At the end of each round, the first mover and the second mover see both reported outcomes and the payoff associated with that round.</li>
    </ol>
