    </h3>

    <p>
        The task has multiple rounds. Each round of the task goes as follows:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The first mover will roll a die and be asked to report the die roll outcome.</li>
        <li>After that, the second mover will see the number the first mover reported.</li>
        <li>Then, the second mover will roll a die and will be asked to report the die roll outcome.</li>
        <li>At the end of each round, the first mover and the second mover will see both reported outcomes and the payoff associated with that round.</li>
    </ol>
