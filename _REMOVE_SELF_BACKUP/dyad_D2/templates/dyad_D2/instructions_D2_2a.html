        If the number that appears on the screen and the number that the participant reports are two different numbers (“no double”), the participant earns 0 euros.
    </p>

    <p>
        The task has multiple rounds. At the end of the experiment, one round is randomly selected to be paid out.
        The participant’s payoff in the task is determined by the number that appeared on the screen and his/her report in that round.
